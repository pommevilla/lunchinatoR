# LunchinatoRs: Map visualization basics

Materials for a talk given at the LunchinatoRs weekly meeting at ISU on 11/20/2020. In this presentation, we go over the basics of working with `sf` objects and work towards building a basic animation of the change in Iowa county populations over the last several years.
